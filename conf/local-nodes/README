This is where to put (hiera) config files to influence the build configuration, based on hostname.  This allows customised, repeatable, consistent builds from a single file.  Just copy the file in here before running maverick --configure for the first time, although it will also work on subsequent runs.

Sample files can be found in /srv/maverick/conf/sample-nodes.
