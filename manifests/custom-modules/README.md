# Maverick custom-modules

This is a location for custom modules to be developed.  It is .gitignore-d so anything added here won't be committed back to github.
Alternatively, add custom modules to ~/code/maverick/custom-modules which is outside of Maverick github altogether, and you can add your own github projects within there, per module.
