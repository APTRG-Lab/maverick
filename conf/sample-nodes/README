The json files in this directory are sample maverick configs that influence the build.
Files starting with 'maverick-' (like maverick-odroidxu4.json) are the actual configs that are used to build the distribution images.

These files can be used by simply changing the hostname of the computer to match, before running maverick configure, eg. `sudo hostname maverick-odroidxu4`.

It is strongly recommended not to alter any files here.  If you wish to alter configuration, copy one of these files to ~/config/maverick/local-nodes and alter it there.  All files in ~/config/maverick/local-nodes (ie. /srv/maverick/config/maverick/local-nodes) are .gitignored and will not be commited back to git in any way.  Files in this directory will, by default, be committed back to git.

Files must have .json extension.
